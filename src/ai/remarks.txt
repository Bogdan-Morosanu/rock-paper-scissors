While running a routine transport missing in the gamma quadrant of our galaxy, your vessel was successfully
boarded by space pirates. Now with all the treasure stowed away and you safely tied up, the crew stands in
front of you expectantly.

From time immemorial, space pirates have been known to follow the space pirate code section 127.1.0.42,
which states that prisoners captured during boarding have the right to a game of rock-paper-scissors (RPS)
that will define their fate. You understand you can play a game of RPS against one of the crew memebers of
your choice. After a number of rounds of your chosing, you must beat your oponent to keep your life. A draw
or a loss against the pirate will lead to your untimely demise.


[FAIL]
As you drift into space without any life support, you spend a moment and reflect. How could you fail to beat
a creature with no hands at a game of rock-paper-scissors?

[SUCCESS]
As soon as you win, you're thrown into a holding cell. A few days later the pirates drop you off at a dusty
space port off the beaten track. You're broke, disoriented and shaken; but you live to tell the tale.
